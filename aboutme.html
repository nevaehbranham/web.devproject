            <p>
            Hello! I'm Nevaeh Branham, a passionate student based in Kennesaw, GA. I love reading, design, and am a first-year IT student at KSU.
                I've recently been exploring some new hobbies like weightlifting and my local gym. I did alot of sports in highschool like swimming, xc and track but,
            I really wanted to do weightlifting and decided to get a personal trainer. Currently, i'm working part-time and a fast-food place (my first job) and am going on a year there.
            I really enjoy learning languages and am currently studying French. I took a few courses in highschool and even some at KSU.
