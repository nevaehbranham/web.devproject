            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p>
            Hey there! I'm Nevaeh Branham, a student living in Kennesaw, GA. I'm all about diving into cool stuff—whether it's getting lost in a good book, geeking out on design, or navigating the wild world of IT as first-year student at KSU.
Lately, I've been exploring some new hobbies. Weightlifting at the local gym has become my go-to. Fun fact: I was big into sports like swimming, XC, and track back in high school. But weightlifting as always seem interesting, so I got a personal trainer to show me the ropes.
Besides hitting the books and exploring the gym, you'll find me hustling part-time at a fast-food joint. Yep, it's been a year of taking orders and filling ice bins – my first job.
Oh, and I'm all about languages. French is my current conquest. I picked up a bit in high school and I'm taking it to the next level at KSU. C'est la vie!
So, that's me in a nutshell—juggling school, work, and a dash of French flair. Ready for whatever life tosses my way!
